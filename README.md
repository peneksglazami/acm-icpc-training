# Archive of problems solutions from competition programming contest (ACM ICPC)

In my student years, I actively participated in programming contests such as [ACM ICPC](https://icpc.global/), [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/), [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam), [Russian Code Cup](https://www.russiancodecup.ru/), etc. For successful performance, I had to prepare a lot: study algorithms, data structures, maths, and train solving problems from various past competitions. During this time, I have accumulated several hundred tasks correctly solved by me. I decided to share the source codes (Pascal/Delphi, C++, Java) of these solutions in this repository.

Solutions are divided into directories according to the sites on which the problem sets are located: 
* `Accepted_The 2000's ACM-ICPC` - [ICPC Live Archive](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu)
* `Accepted_UVA` - [Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org)
* `Accepted_TIMUS` - [Timus Online Judge](https://acm.timus.ru)
